## House Price Project
### Project Overview
The Housing Market in Pakistan Is booming With New Infrastructure Every day. This Has been made successful due to the large demand for Residential Houses. This Project Aims to investigate the different property types and cities that people reside in. This project also aims to unravel where more improvement can be made.
### Objectives

### Data sources
The project originated from a house price dataset on Kaggle, Where the used dataset is on the house prices of houses in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad. It gives information of totally 99,499 houses with each house described in 8 categorical variables.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
**Data Filtering**-It allowed me to display only the rows that meet certain criteria, making it easier to focus on specific information in a large dataset. Here's a basic guide on how to filter data in Excel.

**Data deduplication**-It involved removing duplicate records or entries from the dataset in order to maintain data accuracy and consistency. In Excel, you can perform data deduplication using various methods. It removes entire rows that are considered duplicates based on the selected columns. 


**Data Validation**-It helped control what kind of data can be entered into a cell. It ensures data accuracy and consistency by defining rules or criteria for the input. It is a powerful tool for maintaining data integrity in your Excel sheets. It helps prevent errors and ensures that data adheres to specified criteria, making your spreadsheets more accurate and reliable.

**Data Sampling**-It is the process of selecting a subset of data from your larger dataset for analysis. Sampling can be useful for handling large datasets, performing preliminary analyses, or when it's impractical to work with the entire dataset. Systematic sampling involved selecting the item from the dataset. It allowed for quicker calculations and insights from large datasets while maintaining the integrity of the data's representation.

**Data Cleansing** (or cleaning) is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset, table, or database. It involves identifying incomplete, incorrect, irrelevant, etc., parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting this dirty data. In Excel, data cleansing might involve several steps, depending on the complexity and nature of your data. Duplicates can skew data analysis, leading to inaccurate results. Ensuring that your data follows a consistent format, especially important for dates, categorizations, and any text-based information. Sometimes, numbers are formatted as text, which can prevent calculations or logical operations. Outliers can affect averages and other statistical calculations. Missing data can lead to biased analysis and incorrect conclusions.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The Family house has proved to be more sought after having a high demand in the market. They double the number of flats which closely follow. It also boasts 58.5% of the total housing market making them a sought-after property.
This makes it both a lucrative and also a saturated market in the future. The flats, Upper Portion, and Lower Portion also have a large demand in middle or working-class cities like Karachi.

This shows the number of non-family houses in the market. It is being a residential area. Karachi has the majority of the houses. It is also fair to assume that it may be the most populous with non-Family residents. It also shows that Lahore is a balanced city having both the upper and working class together.
